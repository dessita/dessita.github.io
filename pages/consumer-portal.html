                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>Web App where consumers can safely supply the requested through Tenant’s portal: documents - bank statements and fill in and e-sign documents. This app was build to be used in various business initiatives such as financial aid for housing,  medicaid eligibility and others. Based on the information provided by the consumer a report was created and a pre-evaluation was performed. </p>
                    <h4>The problem</h4>
                    <p>The app needed to display the documentation requested, to allow for easy switch on and off of the types of requested information per tenant and allow user to initiate upload of documents without request. </p>
                    <h4> Team</h4>
                    <p>I was the sole designer on this project and worked with the product manager and a team of 2 developers. </p>


                    <h4>Limitations</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We were bound to use the existing company’s proprietary API . It already supported some of the functionality needed even though it’s architecture was not optimized for this product.</li>
                        <li>We would have to adapt our solution to it in order to save time for releasing the MVP.</li>
                        <li> Also we were to use other 3rd party solutions to shorten the development process.</li>
                        <li> I didn’t have the possibility to speak directly to any of the potential users of the apps, so I could just user test random users that wouldn’t have knowledge of the product or internal users - other employees of my company.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Research & Brainstorming </h4>
                    <p>Because of the limitations mentioned above my research was limited to talking with product and sales team trying to get more insights on the problem we were trying to solve. Also I reviewed screenshots from the government website for Medicaid Applications to get a sense of the kind of information that we need to gather and the process that case managers usually have to go through and of course the requirements my designs had to comply with.

                <h4>Detailed Prototype - First Version</h4>
                    Initially I presented the application in a desktop resolution.
                    <ul>
                        <li> With <b>status labels</b> for creating the urgency for the user to act and see the satisfactory green check instead.</li>
                        <li>Assets & Taxes were the modules we were to offer at the time, but we were expected to add more which actually did happen.    </li>
                        <li>The copy below the "welcome" title is including a name of sample client company - "Testing Inc."   </li>
                    </ul>


                    <div class="d-flex justify-items-start flex-column align-items-center">
                        <div class="text-left img-container">

                    </div>
                <h4>User Testing </h4>
                <p>I performed Guerilla research with 10 participants without prior knowledge of the product requirements and asked them to do specific tasks while I was watching their behavior.
                    The test included:
                    <ul>
                    <li>  First just start from the home page and observe the user browsing unassisted.</li>
                    <li> The user was asked to comment their thoughts while using the prototype as to know if they feel lost what to do or were having trouble completing what they decided to do.</li>
                    <li> Everyone completed a questionnaire about the prototype they interacted with.</li>
                    <li> Also I had an open and honest conversation about how they felt while using it. If they had any concerns, etc. I knew it could be better I had to find how. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <h4>The Problems identified from the User Testing</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Orange colored status labels were accepted as undeserved punishment to the user - who had just logged in for first time in the application</li>
                    <li>Missing to show a logout link when the user is done - lack of direction what is next.</li>
                    </ul>
